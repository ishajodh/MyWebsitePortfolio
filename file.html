<h1>Isha Jodh</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Isha Jodh, and I am 16 years old. I go to
  Skyline High School, and this summer I am attending a Girls Who Code Summer
  Immersion Program at the AT&T location in Seattle. I will be using this
  website as a portfolio over the summer. </p>
<br>
<p>What I like to do: tae kwon do (martial arts), build model rockets, bake,
  read, travel, hang out with family and friends, play with my dog, and paint.
  </p>
<p>What I do not like to do: wake up early in the morning. </p>
<br>
<p>FUN FACT: I am a first degree black belt in tae kwon do. I also teach kids
  and teens martial arts. </p>

<p>Description of Side Scroller Game: The image above is a screenshot of our side
  scroller game. We created a game where the player can choose between 6 different
  sprites to play as, and their objective is to "eat" all of the food. The game
  scrolls through different backgrounds and various foods appear. The amount of
  food eaten is displayed in the top left corner of the screen, and once the
  player has eaten all of the food, he/she wins the game. </p>
