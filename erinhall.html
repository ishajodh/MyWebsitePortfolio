<h1>Guest Speaker: Erin Hall</h1>
<p>Erin talked about asking questions and being confident in high school and
  college. She encouraged us to think about the logic behind computer science,
  especially when looking at websites. Also, she talked about not settling and
  always having the desire to grow and learn more knowledge.</p>
<br>
<p>The main takeaways I have from Erin's talk are: be confident in yourself,
  never be afraid to ask anyone questions, think logically, and never stop
  seeking out new knowledge and opportunities.</p>
