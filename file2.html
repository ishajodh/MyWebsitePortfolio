<h1>Python Shapes Project Reflection</h1>
<p>Both python and scratch can create shapes using loops and variables, which
is what we worked on today. However, they do have some differences. Python uses
more language (words), while Scratch uses more visuals (blocks). In my opinion,
it is easier to use scratch to create visual games than Python.</p>
<br>
<p>When I had to debug my programs throughout the day, it was very frusterating
at first. However, I did enjoy the problem-solving process we all went through
and the joy we all felt when our programs finally worked. For me, the hardest
part was having patience and remaining calm when my program did not work. </p>
